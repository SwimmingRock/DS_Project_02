Data Types:

1. Strings: Strings are used extensively throughout the code to represent various types of data. For example:

- `directory_path` and `directory_name` in the `ShowManager` class represent the path and name of the main directory where shows are stored.
- `subdirectories` is a list of strings that stores the names of subdirectories.
- `file_name` in the `ShotManager` class represents the name of a JSON file.

Strings are used to store textual information such as file paths, directory names, and file names, which are essential for file operations and data retrieval.

2. Lists: The code uses lists to store collections of subdirectories. The `subdirectories` list in the `ShowManager` class holds the names of subdirectories created within the main directory. This list is populated when calling the `get_subdirectories` method. The use of lists allows for easy iteration and management of subdirectories.

3. Dictionaries: Dictionaries are used to store structured data, particularly JSON data. In the code, dictionaries are utilized to represent information about shows, descriptions, and character details. For example:

- The `description` variable in the `ShowManager` class holds a dictionary with show description information, such as the description text.
- The `info` parameter in the `ShotManager` class represents character information and is stored as a dictionary.

Dictionaries provide a convenient way to organize and access key-value pairs, making it suitable for storing structured data with flexible data types.

4. Classes: The code defines two classes, `ShowManager` and `ShotManager`. Classes are used to encapsulate related functions and data, providing a modular and organized approach to managing shows and shots. These classes allow for the creation, deletion, and manipulation of directories, JSON files, and their associated data.

The `ShowManager` class handles operations related to shows, such as creating subdirectories, managing description files, and deleting subdirectories. The `ShotManager` class focuses on managing shots within specific subdirectories, such as creating character information files, retrieving JSON files, editing JSON file content, and deleting JSON files.

Classes provide a way to group related functionality and data, promoting code reusability and organization.

5. File I/O: The code utilizes file input/output (I/O) operations to interact with JSON files. The `json` module is used to handle serialization and deserialization of JSON data. The `open` function is employed to open files in read or write mode.

The `create_json_file` method in the `ShowManager` class demonstrates file I/O by creating a JSON file and dumping the provided data into it. Similarly, the `get_json_file_info` method in the `ShotManager` class reads the contents of a JSON file and returns the corresponding data.

File I/O operations allow for storing and retrieving structured data from JSON files, enabling the persistence of information beyond the program's execution.

6. Control Flow Statements: The code utilizes control flow statements such as `if` and `for` loops to make decisions and iterate over subdirectories and files.

- `if` statements are used to check if directories or files exist before performing operations on them. For example, `if os.path.exists(directory)` in the `create_directory` method checks if a directory already exists before creating it.
- `for` loops are used to iterate over subdirectories and files. For instance, `for entry in os.scandir(directory_path)` in the `get_subdirectories` method iterates over the entries in a directory and appends the names of subdirectories to the `subdirectories` list.

Control flow statements allow for conditional execution of code and iterative operations, providing flexibility and control over the program's behavior.

Overall, the chosen data types and structures, including strings, lists, dictionaries, classes, file I/O, and control flow statements, work together to facilitate the organization, manipulation, and storage of data related to shows and shots. These choices promote code readability, reusability, and maintainability.

The Code also utilizes the principles of classes.

1. Encapsulation: The code encapsulates related data and functionality within the `ShowManager` and `ShotManager` classes. Each class contains properties (attributes) that store relevant information, such as directory paths and file names. The methods (functions) defined within the classes operate on the associated data, providing a cohesive and organized way to manage shows and shots.

2. Abstraction: The classes abstract away the underlying implementation details of managing shows and shots. Users of the classes do not need to know the specific file operations or directory structure; they can interact with the classes using high-level methods that perform the desired actions. This abstraction simplifies the usage of the code and makes it easier to work with shows and shots without dealing with low-level details.

3. Modularity: The classes promote modularity by encapsulating related functionality. The `ShowManager` class handles operations related to creating directories, managing subdirectories, creating and updating JSON files, and deleting subdirectories. The `ShotManager` class focuses on operations specific to shots, such as creating character information, retrieving shot files, editing shot data, and deleting shot files. Each class has a well-defined responsibility and can be used independently or in conjunction with each other.

4. Reusability: The classes are designed to be reusable. Multiple instances of `ShowManager` and `ShotManager` can be created to manage different shows and shots. The methods defined within the classes can be called multiple times with different inputs to perform the desired actions for various shows and shots. This reusability enhances code organization and promotes efficient management of show-related data.

By employing these principles of classes, the code achieves improved code organization, code reuse, and abstraction of complex operations, making it easier to manage shows and shots in a structured and modular manner.

5. Polymorphism was not used as I would like different functionalities of my code to be almost instantly reusable with code written by others. For example a colleague of mine has written a better `ShowManager` class and wants to use my code for only managing the shots. 

Data Model:

The code consists of two main classes: `ShowManager` and `ShotManager`. These classes manage shows and shots, respectively. Here's an overview of the types included in the code and their relationships:

1. `ShowManager`:
   - Properties:
     - `directory_path`: A string representing the path to the main directory where shows are stored.
     - `directory_name`: A string representing the name of the main directory.
   - Methods:
     - `create_directory(directory_path: str, directory_name: str) -> bool`: Creates a directory at the specified path and name if it doesn't already exist.
     - `create_subdirectories(subdirectories: List[str]) -> bool`: Creates subdirectories within the main directory.
     - `get_subdirectories() -> List[str]`: Retrieves a list of subdirectory names within the main directory.
     - `create_json_file(subdir_name: str, filename: str, data: Dict) -> bool`: Creates a JSON file in the specified subdirectory.
     - `get_description_file(subdir_name: str) -> Dict`: Retrieves the content of the description file in the specified subdirectory.
     - `update_description_file(subdir_name: str, description: Dict) -> bool`: Updates the content of the description file in the specified subdirectory.
     - `delete_subdirectory(subdirectory_name: str) -> bool`: Deletes a subdirectory and its contents.

2. `ShotManager`:
   - Properties:
     - `directory_path`: A string representing the path to the subdirectory where shots are stored.
     - `subdirectory_name`: A string representing the name of the subdirectory.
   - Methods:
     - `create_character_info(file_name: str, character_name: str, info: Dict) -> bool`: Creates a JSON file containing character information.
     - `get_json_files() -> bool`: Retrieves a list of JSON files (shots) in the subdirectory.
     - `get_json_file_info(file_name: str) -> Dict`: Retrieves the content of a specific JSON file (shot).
     - `edit_json_file(file_name: str, new_data: Dict) -> bool`: Updates the content of a specific JSON file (shot).
     - `delete_json_file(file_name: str) -> bool`: Deletes a specific JSON file (shot).

Folder Structure:

The chosen folder structure follows a hierarchical organization to store shows and shots. Here's an explanation of the structure:

- Main Directory: The main directory represents the overarching category of shows. It is specified by `directory_path` and `directory_name` in `ShowManager`. The main directory contains subdirectories for each show.

- Subdirectories: Each subdirectory within the main directory represents a specific show. The subdirectories are created using the `create_subdirectories` method in `ShowManager`. Subdirectories are named based on the show's title or a relevant identifier.

- Shots: Within each show's subdirectory, the shots are stored. The `ShotManager` class operates within a specific subdirectory, defined by `directory_path` and `subdirectory_name`. Each shot is represented by a separate JSON file containing the shot's information.

Reasoning:

The chosen structure provides a logical organization for storing and managing shows and shots. The main directory allows for easy categorization of shows, while the subdirectories provide a clear separation between different shows. This structure simplifies the management of show-related files and enables efficient retrieval and manipulation of shot data within each show's context. The use of JSON files for shots allows for structured storage and easy access to shot information.
